### Shop-Shop

### User Story
As a business owner I would like a complete e-commerce shopping experience for my customers. When customers visit my buiness site, they should see items and stock and prices. If they click on an item to add to cart it should display in their cart. When a user adds multiple items to their cart, and then navigate away from the page, when they return to the page, their cart items should still be there. I would also like credit card payments to be processed when a user places their order. At that time they should see an order sucess page.

### Features
This is an ecommerce site that allows users to create an account and login
This site features a cardslide of items with stock values and prices.
users can add items to their cart.
If a user adds items to their cart and navigates away from the page, the cart items persist when they return to the page.
Users can checkout with their cart items and payment will be processed using Stripe
